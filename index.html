  <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to the home page. This is a visual communication major student's page. 
  A student who sees design as a way to translate thoughts, emotions, and stories into visuals. 
  For her, design is about creating meaningful connections and expressing ideas in ways that go beyond words.Or just for the fun of it.
  Currently still exploring her strengths and discovering where she fits best. 
  With a curious mindset, she approaches each project as a learning experience,eager to grow her skills and find her path as a designer.
  Inspired by everyday moments, film, music, and how people interact with their surroundings, design can be intentional, thoughtful, silly. 
  She doesn’t have all the answers yet, but she’s here to keep learning and creating.
  This site is a glimpse into that journey, that will improve as she advances </p>
