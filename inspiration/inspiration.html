      <p style="text-align: left;">Andy Warhol is a designer I admire because of how bold and ahead of his time he was. His work didn't just make a statement it changed the way people saw both art and design.Andy Warhol was bold and ahead of his time. As a Pop Art pioneer, he transformed everyday items into thought-provoking works using color, repetition, and mass media. His blend of commercial and fine art still influences ads, album covers, and branding today.</p>
