Its design scene is rich with inspiration, from minimalist architecture and fashion subcultures to futuristic tech and bold visual storytelling. The city moves with precision and purpose, pushing creatives to think differently and refine their craft. I’d love to experience Tokyo as a designer, but only when I feel ready to meet its high standards.</p>

  <h1>Singapore</h1>

  <div class="topfive-item">
    <img src="img/singapore.png" alt="singapore">

    <div class="topfive-text">
  <p style="text-align: left;">Singapore
is one of Southeast Asia's leading tech and design capitals.
It blends precision, innovation, and cultural diversity, making it a fascinating place to work in UX/UI, branding, or motion design.
It's also a visually stunning city - and to be honest, I can't help but think of "Crazy Rich Asians" every time it comes to mind.</p>
